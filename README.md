# ZK Summit 13 Lampe sandbox

Welcome to this Lampe sandbox created for ZK Summit 13! It should contain all of the dependencies
necessary to get started playing with Lampe all in one place.

Please visit https://github.com/reilabs/lampe/ for the main Lampe repository.

## Quick start guide

* Put your Noir code in `src/`
* Run the `lampe` CLI from the root directory
* The resulting extracted Lean is in the `lampe/Examples/Extracted/` directory
* Because of some funky things about how Github codespaces work you may need to re-generate the
dependencies when you first enter a Lean file, you can do this using the "Refresh dependencies"
command (or the `ctrl`/`cmd`-`shift`-`x` shortcut)

There are a few worked out examples already, but feel free to make your own and try it out!

## Bugs exist!

If you run into anything not working correctly (or unintuitive) then please point it out! Lampe is a
work in progress and we're squashing bugs left and right, so we welcome your help to point out any
issues that exist.
